# Project Title

Predict default of lenders for German Bank Loans

In this project, we go deeper into the analysis of the factors that lead to loan defaults among applicants within the German lending landscape. We analyze German Credit Risk dataset that captures various details of loan applicants and their credit histories to establish contribution of these factors to likelihood of loan default and credit risk assessment. The objective of this analysis is to construct predictive models that help in identifying potential defaults.
